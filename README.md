# TicTacToe
## My very first project with Python list and dictionaries 
This project serves as a practice for me but for you this could consider a walkthrough or a sample one. It's ok if you stuck cause I also did, the first time I tried when I was a beginner. 

So try it yourself and if stuck, check my code! Feel free to leave comment or email me
